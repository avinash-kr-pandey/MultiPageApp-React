                    The software industry includes businesses for development, maintenance and publication of 
                    software that are using different business models, mainly either "license/maintenance based"
                     (on-premises) or "Cloud based" (such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, MBaaS, MSaaS, DCaaS etc.). 
                     The industry also includes software services, such as training, documentation, consulting
                      and data recovery. The software and computer services industry spends more than 11% of its
                       net sales for Research & Development which is in comparison with other industries the second
                        highest share after pharmaceuticals & biotechnology.[1]
